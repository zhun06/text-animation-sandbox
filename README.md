## 🚀 Overview

Text Animation Sandbox is a browser-based playground for creating and experimenting with animated text.

The project started as a single-text sandbox and was later redesigned into a multi-text system after revisiting the codebase and applying object-oriented design concepts learned from my Tetris refactor project.

The goal was to better understand how real creative tools manage multiple elements, styling and interaction.
